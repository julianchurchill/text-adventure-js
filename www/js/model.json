Lots of noise, inhuman howling but also the clear barking of orders from far over the barricade. Someone or something is commanding the assault. Poking your head out from the protection of the shield you glimpse a metal man through the fire and smoke around the barricade, standing on a hill a small distance away. It appears to be directing the assault, pointing into shadows to the side of where it stands and then looking over to you, pointing and a shout which unmistakably means \"Attack!\". The next thing you know a dark shadow falls over the town, encompassing you all. The watch men murmur and brace as a wave of heat, fire and smoke hits the shield knocking it backwards into everyone it is covering. You all pull together and hold the shield in place, the blast of furnace heat and light licking around the edges of the shield, the only thing keeping you alive. You all stand firm and eventually the flames subside, you hear an unearthly roar and the shadow passes over you and everything is still and quiet.<newline><newline>\"Go see Cabal, find out what's happened.

You can see over the barriers quite clearly and look down to see what is contained within, some of which you recognise and some you don't. You wonder to yourself how these creatures are being fed and looked after, they certainly appear to be in good health. From somewhere nearby you can hear a dull thump, rhythmic and familiar, it seems to be timed with the breeze emanating from deeper still within the temple.",

Later biologists determined that this unexpectedly rapid exsanguination could be attributed to the same chemical which allowed the turpet to reconstitute itself after being chopped up. Upon the first chopping it released a sufficient amount into the air to trigger temporary haemophilia and the combination of the chemical and Crane's unwavering experimental determination sealed his fate."

However a single gibbet cannot make any sound at all as the body parts required to produce the sound are at opposing and unreachable ends of the fist-sized insect's body. When one or more gibbets come together they will often conjoin so that the dorsal fin can rub against the ventral fin to produce a piercing but specific note. Each pair of gibbets will produce a different note depending on the size of their fins so that a sort of choir effect will fill the air, hence their common name 'harmonizing gibbets'."
